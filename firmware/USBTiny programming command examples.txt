This firmware can be programmed using a common USBTiny programmer.

Prototypes
==========

To program the fuses on a virgin chip, use the command...

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 6 -U efuse:w:0xff:m - U hfuse:w:0xd7:m -U lfuse:w:0xc4:m 

If you are unsure if the fuses have already been programmed, you can run the above command benignly - it will fail if the fuses wer already set. 

To program the flash memory on a chip that has already had the fuses set, you can use the command...

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 40 -U flash:w:"airboat.firmware.hex":i


Production
==========
You can program a virgin chip much more quickly by combining the FLASH and FUSE operations. By setting the fuses last, we get to
download the FLASH at full speed.

Using HEX file
--------------

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 6 -U flash:w:"airboat.firmware.hex":i -U efuse:w:0xff:m - U hfuse:w:0xd7:m -U lfuse:w:0xc4:m 

Using ELF file*
---------------

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 6 -U flash:w:airboat.firmware.elf:e -U efuse:w:airboat.firmware.elf:e - U hfuse:w:airboat.firmware.elf:e -U lfuse:w:airboat.firmware.elf:e

It may be possible to speed that command up even more by changing the "-B 6" to "-B 4", but this will only work reliably if you have
high quality connections so test before rolling out. 


*ELF file format not supported in the the recent WinAVR release, so you must download AVRDUDE directly. It is available from...
