This firmware can be programmed using a common USBTiny programmer.

Prototypes
==========

To program the fuses on a virgin chip, use the command...

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 6 -U efuse:w:0xff:m - U hfuse:w:0xd7:m -U lfuse:w:0xc4:m 

If you are unsure if the fuses have already been programmed, you can run the above command benignly - it will fail if the fuses wer already set. 

To program the flash memory on a chip that has already had the fuses set, you can use the command...

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 40 -U flash:w:"airboat.firmware.hex":i


Production
==========
You can program a virgin chip much more quickly by combining the FLASH and FUSE operations. By setting the fuses last, we get to download the 
FLASH at full speed.

Here is the command to program FLASH and FUSE on a virgin chip in a single operation...

avrdude -p t25 -c usbtiny -B 6 -U flash:w:"airboat.firmware.hex":i -U efuse:w:0xff:m - U hfuse:w:0xd7:m -U lfuse:w:0xc4:m 

It may be possible to speed that command up even more by changing the "-B 6" to "-B 4", but this will only work reliably if you have very good 
connections so test before rolling out.
